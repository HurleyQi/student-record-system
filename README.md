# student-record-system

This Java-based project integrates with MySQL databases using both JDBC for direct server connections and MyBatis, a persistence framework facilitating Java application interaction with relational databases. The frontend utilizes Tomcat, an implementation of Java Servlets, to manage user interactions.

Currently, the project supports the recording and management of student enrollment data, class schedules, and related information. The database can easily be changed to host other sorts of information with minimal changes.
